# Hang that man!
Hang that man! is an alternative of the classic word game 'Hangman'. It is built using Python and runs through the
Code institute mock terminal on [Heroku](<https://third-portfolio-project-mjc.herokuapp.com>).

# User Experience
Users may attempt to guess the hidden word using either letter or word guesses. The game is over when the user guesses correctly
or runs out of attempts.

## Flowchart
The Flowchart for Hang that man! was built using [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/diagrams/features/flowchart-tool/).

The flowchart consists of the game flow and primary gameplay loop. The user is prompeted to input a name and select a difficulty. After this, the hidden answer is calculated and the number of attempts the user is given is dynamically calculated. A prompt is then built to store and display the user's correct guesses. Once the starting prompt is created, the main gameplay loop runs until the user either wins or loses.

The user is prompted to input either a letter or word guess into the console. If the user inputs a word it is checked if it matches the hidden word. When the user guesses correctly, the prompt is filled in and the user wins the loop. When the user guesses incorrectly, the number of attempts is decreased by one.
If the user inputs a letter the program checks if the letter is within the hidden word. If the guess is correct, the prompt is updated with the correct guess in the correct place(s). If the guess is incorrect, the number of attempts is decreased by one.
The main gameplay loop ends when the user either correctly guesses the word, using either letters or word guesses, or runs out of attempts.

# Existing Features

![Opening Game Console](assets/readme_images/console_hangman_intro.png)

## User Name Input
The user is prompted, during the initial loop of the game, to input a name. The name is checked to ensure it is containing only letters and does not contain symbols or numbers. If the user inputs an invalid name, the program prompts them to enter a new name and explains the valid input for a name. If the user inputs a valid name, the input is stored as the user_name variable.
The user_name variable is used to add a personal touch to the game experience for the user.

## Difficulty Selection
The user is prompted to choose a difficulty, with either easy or hard as options. When the user selects a difficulty, the program selects a random word from the appropriate list and stores it as the word_to_guess variable. If the user inputs an invalid option, an error message is generated and the user is prompted again.

## Dynamic Attempts
Once the user selects a difficulty, the program the sets the number of attempts the user gets for guessing the answers. A value equal to one quater of the hidden word is added to the base attempt of six. This attempt calculation guarentees a minimum amount of attempts for the hangman images to work with, while also maintaining dynamic difficulty. The attempts are displayed to the user throughout the game so they do not need to scroll in order to see their remaining attempts.

## Word Prompt
The word to guess that the difficulty selector created is used to build a prompt to help the user guess. The prompt builder creates a series of underscore lines ("_") equal to the length of the word to guess

![Hangman image console](assets/readme_images/console_hangman_game_a.png)

## Dynamic Hangman Image
The hangman image uses the dynamic attempts calculation to display the hangman image according to the number of attempts the user has left. For the final six attempts, the images of the hangman stages cycle through as the user runs out of attempts. Prior to this, text is displayed providing context for the user.

![Win/Loss Image](assets/readme_images/console_hangman_win_loss.png)

## Win/Loss tracker
The user is provided with a running tally of their wins and losses during the running of the program. So long as the user chooses to continue playing, the tally will keep track of their progress and inform them at the end of each game.

# Desired Features
* Leaderboard system to track different user's wins and losses.
* Hints for words to add additional interactivity.
* Help function that may be called during the game to remind user of rules.

# Testing and Quality Control

Hang that man! was tested in both Gitpod during development and on the Heroku Terminal following deployemnt.
Expected results from user inputs were checked and corrected when errors occured as follows:

1. **Program Start**
    - Confirmed program started without crashes.
    - Introduction displayed without issue.
    - Username input prompt runs on startup as expected.
2. **Username Input**
    - Confirmed valid username input stored in variable.
    - Erroneous inputs call error message and input prompt agaas expected.
3. **Rules Function**
    - Confirmed rules function ran following username input.
    - Confirmed valid rules input calls rules display for user.
    - Confirmed valid play input skips rules display to difficulty selection.
    - Erroneous inputs call error message and input prompt as expected.
4. **Difficulty Selection**
    - Confirmed that valid input pulls random word from correct word list.
    - Erroneous input calls error message and input prompt as expected.
5. **Dynamic Attempts**
    - Confirmed attempts calculator runs as expected.
    - Minimum attempts maintained during calculation.
6. **Responsive Hangman Picture**
    - Confirmed hangman image starts at correct number of remaining attempts.
    - Confirmed text and image are both correctly coloured at all stages.
7. **Guessed Letters Tracker**
    - Confirmed user inputs stored in appropriate lists.
    - Repeat user inputs correctly call error message and input prompt.
8. **Win and Loss Parameters**
    - Confirmed win state correctly activates on all correct letters guessed.
    - Confirmed win state correctly activates on user correctly guessing the word.
    - Confirmed loss state correctly activates when user runs out of attempts.
9. **Win and Loss Tracker**
    - Confirmed win and loss score update correctly following the appropriate win or loss state.
    - Confirmed "Play Again" prompt runs after score is updated.
10. **Play Again function**
    - Confirmed game repeats at difficulty selection when user inputs "Y".
    - Confirmed game returns to start of the program when user selects otherwise.

All python files pass through validation using the [Pep8](http://pep8online.com) online software. All files pass through with no errors present.

The example for the run.py result are below:

## Device and Browser Testing

Hang that man! was tested on the Opera, Google Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft edge browsers. Heroku correctly displayed and ran the program on all browsers.

The game successfully ran through Heroku without errors occuring on the following devices:
* Windows Desktop
* iPad mini 3
* Moto g50
* iPhone 4s

User testing took place via friends and family to identify bugs and issues with user experience.

# Bugs

During development the following bugs were identified and corrected:
* Name input would store an invalid entry to the name variable on user input and would not be replaced by the repeat entry. Moving the return function corrected the error.
* Difficulty selection would store an invalid entry and would not be replaced by the repeat entry. Moving the return function corrected the error.
* Console size was too wide during development. Adjusted code to fit within parameters.
* User score function would reset for each run of main loop. Changed score storage to list fixed issue.
* Name input continued to store erroneous input, modified return code and function structure to fix.
* Program stopped unexpectedly after second playthrough. Removed break statement from main function to fix issue.
